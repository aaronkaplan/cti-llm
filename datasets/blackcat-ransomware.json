Operating a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting for affiliates in known cyber crime forums which would leverage the ransomware in return for 80%-90% of the ransom. The rest would be paid to the BlackCat author. The malware itself is coded in the Rust programming language, which is not often observed in the ransomware space. By leveraging this programming language, the malware authors are able to easily compile it against various operating system architectures. Given the numerous native options, Rust is highly customizable which facilitates the group\u2019s ability to pivot and  individualize its attacks.  The threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the \"BlackCat gang\u201d, utilize numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space. Notably, the use of multiple extortion techniques to include the siphoning of data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if ransom is not paid, and DDoS attacks.", "id": "report--afe1a8b7-58ab-4232-971f-b96abae8657c", "labels": ["atom-playbook", "intrusion-set"], "modified": "2022-01-13T19:45:08.446Z", "name": "BlackCat Ransomware", "object_refs": ["intrusion-set--2dab2332-8558-4b2b-8d5d-dd394411517c", "report--514c2b57-c1c0-4047-b363-2c5a565ba133"], "published": "2022-01-05T17:54:50.864Z", "type": "report"}, {"created": "2022-01-05T17:54:50.864Z", "id": "intrusion-set--2dab2332-8558-4b2b-8d5d-dd394411517c", "modified": "2022-01-13T19:45:08.446Z", "name": "BlackCat Ransomware", "type": "intrusion-set"}, {"created": "2022-01-07T20:23:09.069Z", "created_by_ref": "identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5", "description": "Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software.
