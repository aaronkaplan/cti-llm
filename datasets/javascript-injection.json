This campaign injects malicious JavaScript code into the website, redirecting users to malicious content such as adware and scam pages. We detect the injected JavaScript code on more than 51K websites, including hundreds of websites in Tranco\u2019s top 1 Million website ranking list. \n\nThis malicious JavaScript injection campaign is multifaceted where malware tries to bypass detection through various techniques, such as obfuscation, benign append attacks, and performs multistep injections before redirecting to malicious web pages. Malware authors leverage these techniques to inject multiple variants of malicious JavaScript code samples into the websites.\n\nUnit42 researchers suspect that a large number of websites could be compromised due to one or more vulnerable WordPress plugins. The exploitation of WordPress plugins for a similar campaign was reported in this [blog](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/massive-wordpress-javascript-injection-campaign-redirects-to-ads.html) by Sucuri researchers.
