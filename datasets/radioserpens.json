However, the organization may use whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy without decrypting the traffic.;TITLE:Deploy Network-based Anti-malware Tools CONTROL:v6 8.5 DESCRIPTION:Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.;TITLE:Malware Defenses CONTROL:v7 8 DESCRIPTION:Malware Defenses;TITLE:Malware Defenses CONTROL:v6 8 DESCRIPTION:Malware Defenses;"], "x_panw_coa_bp_references": ["\u201cWildFire Fails Forwarding File to Cloud for Encrypted Traffic\u201d - https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/docs/DOC-6845:\u201cWildfire Administrator's Guide 9.0 (English) - Forward Decrypted SSL Traffic for Wildfire Analysis' - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/wildfire/9-0/wildfire-admin/submit-files-for-wildfire-analysis/forward-decrypted-ssl-traffic-for-wildfire-analysis.html#:\u201cWildfire Administrator's Guide 9.0 (English) - Wildfire Best Practices' - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/wildfire/9-0/wildfire-admin/wildfire-deployment-best-practices/wildfire-best-practices.html#"]}, {"type": "identity", "id": "identity--c6f27733-7387-4685-946e-3159d72ba15f", "identity_class": "organization", "name": "Identity (MechaFlounder)", "created": "2019-10-07T16:30:50.432Z", "modified": "2019-10-08T18:27:49.376Z", "sectors": ["government-national"], "x_cta_country": ["TR"]}, {"type": "indicator", "id": "indicator--13a5365a-894f-47a3-9ce4-6cf85718419f", "created": "2018-05-30T13:30:36.464Z", "modified": "2019-07-25T12:40:56.050Z", "name": "win10-update.com", "pattern": "[domain-name:value = 'win10-update.com']", "valid_from": "2018-05-30T13:30:36.464Z", "labels": ["malicious-activity"]}, {"type": "indicator", "id": "indicator--f2eb1d6c-df89-49e2-97f8-5c58706e9519", "created": "2018-11-13T14:12:17.661Z", "modified": "2020-06-01T16:53:14.941Z", "name": "0282b7705f13f9d9811b722f8d7ef8fef907bee2ef00bf8ec89df5e7d96d81ff", "pattern": "[file:hashes.'SHA-256' = '0282b7705f13f9d9811b722f8d7ef8fef907bee2ef00bf8ec89df5e7d96d81ff']", "valid_from": "2018-11-13T14:12:17.661Z", "labels": ["malicious-activity"]}, {"type": "malware", "id": "malware--9f58383b-5165-4021-b2a9-35d4a7b75302", "name": "Mechaflounder", "labels": ["backdoor"], "created": "2019-10-11T15:03:34.457Z", "modified": "2019-10-14T17:02:52.363Z", "description": " Python-based payload associated with the RADIO SERPENS threat actor.
