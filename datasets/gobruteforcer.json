However, the organization may use whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy without decrypting the traffic.;TITLE:Deploy Network-based Anti-malware Tools CONTROL:v6 8.5 DESCRIPTION:Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.;TITLE:Malware Defenses CONTROL:v7 8 DESCRIPTION:Malware Defenses;TITLE:Malware Defenses CONTROL:v6 8 DESCRIPTION:Malware Defenses;", "x_panw_coa_bp_description": "Allow the firewall to forward decrypted content to WildFire.
