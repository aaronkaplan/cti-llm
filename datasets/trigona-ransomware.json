Although this blog will be discussing this newer variant, Unit 42 is aware that there was a previously-unnamed variant of Trigona found in the wild in early 2022. \n\nDuring the incident response engagement, Unit 42 discovered Trigona\u2019s operator(s) obtained initial access to their target\u2019s environment, conducted reconnaissance, transferred malware via remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, created new user accounts, and deployed ransomware.\n\nTrigona\u2019s ransom notes are unique; rather than the usual text file, they are instead presented in an HTML Application with embedded JavaScript containing unique campaign IDs and victim IDs. \n\nFrom the ransom notes, we discovered that Trigona operator(s) further intimidate victims by threatening double extortion: in addition to encrypting files in the victims\u2019 system with a ._locked extension, the operator(s) claim to steal data. If victims do not pay the ransom demand, the operator(s) threaten to auction off the data. Trigona has a new name-and-shame extortion site that is, at the time of writing, available on the Surface Web.\n\nTrigona has infrastructure and capability that overlaps with Crylock ransomware. Both operations share a specific email address for victim\u2019s to contact. Also, there are similarities in the ransom note\u2019s format and content.\n", "id": "report--d9fd4cdf-5362-49f6-9b57-7cf54f6040cb", "labels": ["atom-playbook", "intrusion-set"], "modified": "2023-03-03T13:44:46.658Z", "name": "Trigona Ransomware ", "object_refs": ["intrusion-set--4aa7a157-3f8c-4f24-83e9-6b0c20d86172", "report--4ea29423-bd9d-4ca3-aebc-7c6d8386cc5e"], "published": "2022-08-10T20:49:29.033Z", "type": "report"}, {"created": "2023-03-03T11:46:49.417Z", "id": "intrusion-set--4aa7a157-3f8c-4f24-83e9-6b0c20d86172", "modified": "2023-03-03T13:44:46.658Z", "name": "Trigona Ransomware", "type": "intrusion-set"}, {"created": "2023-03-03T13:08:40.818Z", "created_by_ref": "identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5", "description": "Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software.

Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation.

Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.\n\nTwo common accessibility programs are <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as \"sticky keys\", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)\n\nDepending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways. Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The [Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012) debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.\n\nFor simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with \"cmd.exe\" (or another program that provides backdoor access).
