# Use-cases for LLMs in CTI

The most important use cases are:

1) Summarization of free text CTI 
2) NER  (Name Entity Recognition)
3) Q&A  (Answering questions on CTI texts)
4) TTP Tagging (extract the TTPs from the text)
5) Graph relationship extraction: extract the graph of who did what with with tools against whom etc... (the "w" questions).
